            <div class="collapsible-body"><p>On 1st Febuary , Around 170 registered students attended the
              DA-IICT's First Android Study jam session. Everyone was very excited to dive into the world
              of Android development.
              The session started with a brief introduction, the motive of the sessions and the benefits
              of learning this Technology to change people's life.

              For fast-paced learning and in order to provide good mentoring to all the students, the
              sessions will run a 2-Track course, One for Beginners and other for student who already have
              at least a basic hands-on android development experience. The Advanced track comprised of 30
              odd Developers.

              In the Beginner’s track, the topic was to get up and running with Android Studio and its
              basic layouts and other functional tools.
              <br><br>In the Advanced track, Everyone first discussed and brainstormed ideas on the Cool
              stuff they wished to make as Projects. They shared their previous Projects if any.
              Thereafter, students formed teams amongst themselves and decided to work on some ideas that
              excited them.
              The first project, i.e. to make a fully-functional Timetable synced with the Academic
              calendar for the students was finalized and the next few sessions would walk them through
              getting it done.
              In this session, we made different linear layouts and json objects for the Timetable.
              The next assignment was to finish up creating objects of days and courses, completing the
              layouts and coming up with some innovative additions to the app.

            <div class="collapsible-body"><p>GDG DA-IICT had successfully conducted a session on GSOC on
              11th January,2016. GSOC is Google Summer of Code, a very prestigious international platform
              to contribute to open source. It is an international annual program where participants are
              supposed to complete an open source software coding project and get a stipend for that.

              In this session two our team members namely Rishi Shah and Yash Shah, gave a talk on GSOC
              and a guideline on how to go about it. Rishi Shah from B.Tech 2nd year had got GSOC in 2015
              in his first year. Yash Shah, a pass out from B.Tech 2014 Batch had also cracked GSOC in his
              first year too, has founded a start up called Arreysun and is cofounder at appbase.io .

              They showed the people how to get started with your dream of cracking GSOC so that we end up
              in a positive scenario. The turn up was very good with around 150 students where the number
              of boys were considerably greater than that of girls. The session went smoothly without any
              technical glitches and all the students seemed to be very pumped up about it at the end of
              the session.

              <p><b>Event Summary</b><br>
                This year we at GDG, DA-IICT organized our Devfest, preparations for which had started
                about a month ago. On the day of the event we started at 9 am with some of the remaining
                registrations both from our college as well as others while the events started at 10.
                The first session, which lasted an hour, was on the philosophy of material design by Mr.
                Samir Motwani, Creative Director at RapidOps Solutions. He started off with what
                material design is and showed various sample websites and apps regarding the same. He
                talked about how it is fast becoming popular and will soon become the industry standard.
                He also took a lot of interesting questions from the audience as well as some of the
                other speakers.

                A lightning talk which started at 11.15 was given next by Ankit Muchhala, a student from
                DA-IICT who is also a developer at Play Power labs. The talk was on his development
                stack and also consisted of various tools like Yeoman, Heroku, Egghead.io, Kapeli Dash,
                npm, Tower etc.

                The next session started at 11.45 and was about Android wireframing, mockups and
                prototyping conducted by Dhrumil Shah from GDG Ahmedabad. He talked about these stages
                of creating an app. He stressed upon the importance of first solving a problem and
                making a blueprint before actually writing the code.

                This session was then succeeded by a lunch break along with a networking session. There
                was a lot of interaction between the students of the various colleges and the speakers.
                We had pizzas and people enjoyed a lot. People shared their interests, past projects and
                talked about themselves in this break.

                After lunch the next session was on Angular JS by Jayesh Anandani, founder of Webelight
                Solutions. Through an example code he explained the shift from JQuery to Angular. He
                talked about what two-way data binding is and how it forms the core principle of
                Angular. The session lasted an hour going up to 2.30 pm.

                The next session was by Dhaval Pandit, marketing head, RapidOps solutions. He talked
                about the importance of analytics based business strategies when it comes to creating a
                successful product. He also talked the various tools that they used to collect the
                relevant data required for the analysis.

                Next was a hangout with Dushyant Jadeja, from GDG Bangalore. His talk was a deep dive
                into Material UI and Polymer. He in detail explained the advantages of Polymer and
                showed various examples. He also explained the basics of the Polymer elements.
                We concluded with a very brief lightning talk by Ishit Mehta from Arpanet Marketing
                Solutions. He talked about his startup and the business aspects of establishing and
                running a successful venture.

              and Rishi Shah conducted this hands-on session on Google's Polymer Framework. The event
              despite of seeing a very limited number of attendees, was able to inspire few of the
              attendees to actually develop their course projects using the polymer framework.

            <div class="collapsible-body"><p>GDG organized a hands-on session on Phonegap on September 28,
              2015. The speaker was Lakhan Samani, a member of GDG from the M.Sc. IT 2014 batch. Almost 30
              students attended the session. The session saw equal participation from girls and boys.
              Majority of the attendees were from the M.Sc. IT program. Phonegap is a technology that
              helps build cross platform mobile applications using only HTML and JavaScript. We faced some
              issues with network connectivity during the session because of which many participants
              couldn't code hands-on.
